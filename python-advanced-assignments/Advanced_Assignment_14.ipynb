    "### 1. Is an assignment operator like += only for show? Is it possible that it would lead to faster results at the runtime ?\n",
    "    Answer: 'A=A+1' evaluates to finding 'A', adding 1 to it. Then storing the value again in variable 'A'. This expression makes Python to look for memory holder of a twice. But 'A+=1' simply means value of 'A' is to incremented by 1. As memory address has to be identified once, '+=' leads to faster operation. "
